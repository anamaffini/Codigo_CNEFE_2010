# Codigo_CNEFE_2010
CÃ³digo CNEFE 2010 is an open-source Python pipeline for reading, spatializing, and categorizing the CNEFE 2010 data from IBGE. It parses fixed-width TXT files, builds unique block-face identifiers, classifies address uses, and links the results directly to IBGE block-face shapefiles. Outputs are provided in GeoPackage (GPKG) and CSV formats.
